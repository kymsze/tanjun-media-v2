### our approach

Our winter athletes perhaps don’t share the same profile as their summer counterparts, so the challenge was to connect the Team GB audience with a group of athletes that they previously had little knowledge of.

But before we did that, we needed to kick the campaign off with a bang….

### Athlete Stat Cards

During the games, Team GB needed to announce which individual athletes we’re competing and when. To do this we created individual stat cards for over 70 athletes that featured key stats and showcased their personality. 

This content series was deemed to be so strong, it was sold to Aldi as a sponsorship opportunity. A landmark moment in how Team GB optimise commercial opportunities for content.

### 360 Team Announcements

Team announcements leading up to the games are a key opportunity to drive awareness of the individual sports. We created an innovative solution which announced each team online through a 360 video.

### Digital Displays

Before, during and after the games, we produced a series of pieces that were featured on massive outdoor digital displays up and down the country. We even took over Piccadilly Circus as we welcomed home our heroes.

### Steep & chill 

To top it all off, we went out with a bang with a seven part series called Steep & Chill. Working with H&K and DFS, we produced a series of comedy gaming episodes. These pieces ran during and after the games bringing our athletes to a whole new audience. 

The Steep & Chill series generated over 1 million views.
