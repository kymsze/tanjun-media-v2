### A Foundation

We built a complete content strategy from the ground up by deconstructing their audience into key passion points. We proposed a three tier approach to content creation which provided clarity on what needed to be made. These are the content tiers we applied and their primary purpose:

#### Tier One:
Engaging the core audience and developing the existing Triathlon community

#### Tier Two:
Content that is tied to passion points that would appeal beyond the core triathlon audience

#### Tier Three:
The ‘big ‘bombs’. Content executions that would go way beyond their current audience and would yield big returns.

### Athlete Profiles

As part of their base content we sought to raise the profile of all of their athletes. We did this by creating highly personable snapshots of all of their athletes. A unique look at their personalities that would help to build a relationship with Tri’s growing communities.

### Tutorials

Sometimes you just need to make content that’s useful. With Triathlon growing at a rate of knots, more and more people are looking to learn about the technical aspects of training for essentially three sports. We helped, by creating a tutorial series that would help to build a solid offering of content for British Tri’s Youtube channel and newsletters.

### Membership

For the sport to thrive, British Tri needs support from its members. We aimed to help them increase their membership base with a series of content executions that included profiles of first time triathlon competitors and grassroots ‘Go Tri’ events, presenting Triathlon as an accessible sport for all!

### A Little Extra

We also offered support in equipping and up skilling the team to create content in-house. Thus allowing content output to increase significantly, leading to better engagement and community building.

As a result, British Triathlon’s content has transformed their online presence and allowed them to position themselves as a leading sporting body in British sport.
