**A Foundation** We built a complete content strategy from the ground up by deconstructing their audience into key passion points. We proposed a three tier approach to content creation which provided clarity on what needed to be made. These are the content tiers we applied and their primary purpose:

***Tier One:*** Engaging the core audience and developing the existing Triathlon community

***Tier Two:*** Content that is tied to passion points that would appeal beyond the core triathlon audience

***Tier Three:*** The ‘big ‘bombs’. Content executions that would go way beyond their current audience and would yield big returns.

**Athlete Profiles** As part of their base content we sought to raise the profile of all of their athletes. We did this by creating highly personable snapshots of all of their athletes. A unique look at their personalities that would help to build a relationship with Tri’s growing communities.

**Tutorials** Sometimes you just need to make content that’s useful. With Triathlon growing at a rate of knots, more and more people are looking to learn about the technical aspects of training for essentially three sports. We helped, by creating a tutorial series that would help to build a solid offering of content for British Tri’s Youtube channel and newsletters.

**Membership** For the sport to thrive, British Tri needs support from its members. We aimed to help them increase their membership base with a series of content executions that included profiles of first time triathlon competitors and grassroots ‘Go Tri’ events, presenting Triathlon as an accessible sport for all!

**A Little Extra** We also offered support in equipping and up skilling the team to create content in-house. Thus allowing content output to increase significantly, leading to better engagement and community building.

As a result, British Triathlon’s content has transformed their online presence and allowed them to position themselves as a leading sporting body in British sport.
