- Winter is coming
- Haha yeah we like Game of Thrones also!!
- No! Winter is coming! We’re approaching one year until the Winter Olympics and we
  want you guys to create all of the content for the campaign.
- Blimey! That’s great! BTW we’ve actually never watched Game of Thrones.
- Dragons and naked girls basically, you’re not missing much! Anyway, we really want
  to ramp our content up and create the same buzz there is around the Summer Games.
- No problem. Our monkeys can adapt to any climate! Let’s hit the slopes.

### our approach

<div class='image two-one'>
<img src='/uploads/solution-1.gif'>
</div>

Our winter athletes perhaps don’t share the same profile as their summer counterparts, so the challenge was to connect the Team GB audience with a group of athletes that they previously had little knowledge of.
But before we did that, we needed to kick the campaign off with a bang….

### perception vs reality

<div data-vimeo-id='277968386' class='iframe'></div>
<a href='//vimeo.com/277968386' data-lity class='video-filter'></a>
</div>

Team GB’s winter athletes have come a long way in the last 30 years, so we set out to tell the story of Team GB over the decades and build anticipation of this exciting new crop of athletes that were set to make history.
This piece generated 250k organic views. An incredible result!

<a href='//vimeo.com/284167063' data-lity class='video-filter'>  </a>
</div>

We set out to build the profile of 10 specific winter athletes running up to the games. We achieved this through mobile optimised 60 second profiles that married the athlete’s own social media posts with visual effects.
These generated over 100k views each.
